# RockPaperScissors

<p>This project was done in two stages: one where I focused only on making the game work from the console, and the last where I added an UI to be more interactive and be playable from a website.</p>

<h2>Learnings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I improved my understanding of the DOM by implementing tools that allowed me to take my game (which could only be played from te console) to the DOM.</li>
  <li>I first made a layout of the game in paper so I could have an idea of the arrangement of my code both in html and css (which I belive allowed me to efficiently use time).</li>
  <li>I implemented a similar approach from the previous point on the javascript so I would not spend a lot of time on trial and error of code writing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Areas of improvement</h2>
Once I have a code I am happy with, I need to review to improve the code. In this instance I think I could shorten the javascript with functions instead of repeating many of the same lines inside the if cases.
